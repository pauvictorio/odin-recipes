TOP Project: Recipes

Recipes, my first ever finished project for The Odin Project. 

In this project, my knowledge of HTML was reinforced. 
I was also finally able to get my hands dirty on Git. Had a bit of a stumble when local changes did not
match the remote. Fortunately, StackOverflow is there to help. I learned about forced push, which I
used to forcibly match the local and remote changes.
